                  <h2 className="pt-4 pb-1 text-xl font-bold text-white">‚Ä¢ Increased Visibility</h2>
                  By showcasing their skills and projects, developers can gain recognition within their local community and beyond. This visibility can be crucial for freelance
                  developers or those seeking new career opportunities.
                  <h2 className="pt-4 pb-1 text-xl font-bold text-white">‚Ä¢ Community Awareness</h2>
                  Keeps developers in tune with their local tech community by providing insights into the top developers, helping users stay connected and engaged with regional
                  tech trends and opportunities.

                  For those looking to build a team or collaborate on projects, GeoGit's ability to focus on local talent simplifies the search for compatible and skilled partners.{" "}

                  <h2 className="pb-1 text-xl font-bold text-white">‚Ä¢ Scope & Focus</h2>
                  Unlike LinkedIn, GitHub or Crunchbase, which generally focus on the big picture, GeoGit can emphasize local software development communities, offering a unique
                  lens into regional talent and trends. <h2 className="pt-4 pb-1 text-xl font-bold text-white">‚Ä¢ Objective Metrics</h2>
                  GeoGit uses a combination of followers, public repositories, and commits to objectively rank developers. This differs from LinkedIn, where visibility often
                  depends on networking skills, or GitHub, where activity isn't always a reflection of influence or skill.
                  <h2 className="pt-4 pb-1 text-xl font-bold text-white">‚Ä¢ Developer Profiles</h2>
                  While platforms like GitHub focus primarily on code repositories, GeoGit provides a more holistic view of a developer, including their social media presence,
                  which offers a more rounded perspective on their professional persona.
                  <h2 className="pt-4 pb-1 text-xl font-bold text-white">‚Ä¢ Ease of Use</h2>
                  GeoGit simplifies the process of finding leading developers in a specific region, a task that can be challenging on more generalized platforms like LinkedIn. The
                  platform also accomadates for technical and non-technical users alike.
